Things to avoid in your route
=============================

Some things make the route more difficult or less reliable to complete, and should be avoided when
possible.

Gemstones
---------
The on-reward-pickup voice line for Gemstones can have very surprising behavior. It's very hard to
control because it's rolled using the RNG from combat (before reset) and if it causes extra increments
or an unknown number of increments, it can cause the run to be lost.

Excessive RNG Manipulation Inputs
---------------------------------
Each RNG manipulation input required in a room increases the chance of a
runner missing an input and falling off-route. Manipulations also take time,
which makes the route slower. Even if the timer is paused, a slower route is
less enjoyable to play and the runner can do fewer attempts because each
attempt takes longer.

As a rough guideline, ForgottenKane and Vorime would try to keep each room to
seven or fewer manip inputs in early access routing. With the advent of tools
like the door prediction mod, it is very fast to try large numbers of increments and tempting
to have high numbers of manips rather than backtracking. Try to avoid this temptation.

In Styx especially, the route requirements are very low so there are a lot of possible routes
and finding one is relatively quick, so it's worthwhile to optimize for fewer manips.

Required manips at surprising times
------------------------------------
Most RNG manipulation in a route happens either a) right before doors unlock or b) right
before you do the thing you want to manipulate (open a well, buy a boon, get a reward from
Eurydice, etc). Runners will quickly get used to doing manipulations at these times. It's possible
to create routes that require manipulations at other times - for example, asking them to summon
before picking up a boon or drinking from a fountain to put their summon voiceline on cooldown.
The runner is more likely to forget this manip because of its odd timing, so if it bricks the run
it can be especially frustrating. Sometimes this kind of oddly timed manip will be faster - as long
as there is an alternate slow way to do the route, so that the run can be continued if the surprising
manip is missed.

Losing a Death Defiance
-----------------------
Losing a death defiance is slow. It reduces your health, which can make subsequent chaos gates trickier, and
takes away High Confidence. It also affects the contents of Wells of Charon, since you aren't offered Kiss of Styx
in the first slot if you are at full DDs - generally, it's better to assume the runner's competence, and provide a
backup strategy (if possible) if they take a DD rather than requiring it.

Losing a DD also ruins the aesthetic of a "run that goes perfectly".

Rooms with no RNG Manipulation
------------------------------
Rooms where you go directly to the exit without any RNG manipulation are fast, but require a
lot of testing. Each RNG manipulation you add at the end of a room gives the runner some
"buffer" to make changes in case something goes differently for them than for you. Many things
will vary the voicelines played between different runners; unless you've tried these variations
it's possible to create a route that will only be possible in a very narrow set of circumstances.

Large Rooms
-----------
In addition to being slower because there's simply more distance to cross, large rooms also
have more spawn points. This means they will have more possible spawn patterns, and more of
a difference between fast and slow spawn patterns.

Depending on Money from Enemies
-------------------------------
The amount of money you get in a route varies quite a lot from run to run. Routes tend
to very money-intensive because you need to buy a lot of Light of Ixions at key points
in order to stay on route. It's tempting to route in buying rewards in shops at every
opportunity, but buying unnecessary rewards can cause the runner to be short later on and
brick an otherwise good run. 

Routing in fixed sources of money such as from gold pots or room rewards can help a lot with
this. Another common fixed source of money is to take a boon for the purpose of selling -
just make sure that you're actually offered the opportunity to sell it in the next midbiome.

"Good Enough" Rewards
---------------------
The routed category is about the aesthetics of a well-planned and constructed route
as well as about going fast. Make sure to get Epic boons. Make sure there is a reason
for every reward you select.
