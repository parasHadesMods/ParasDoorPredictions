# ParasDoorPredictions
Hades Mod for predicting the contents of the next room.

Goals:
 - make it faster to route speedruns of hades
 - compatibility with other quality-of-life routing mods (eg. RngDisplayMod, StartingBoonSelector)
 - route compatibility with unmodded hades (so that routes are valid for the leaderboard)
 - accuracy of prediction
 
Non-goals:
 - compatibility with gameplay mods

To install, git clone into your Mods directory and run modimporter.py.
Requires ModUtil and RngDisplayMod. 

For now, the focus is on any heat runs, so accurate handling of Approval Process and other high-heat specific modifiers is not a priority. PRs that add these feature would be welcome.
