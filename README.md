# ParasDoorPredictions
Hades Mod for predicting the contents of the next room.

Press "Gift" once the doors unlock to show what's behind them.

Goals:
 - make it faster to route speedruns of hades
 - compatibility with other quality-of-life routing mods (eg. RngDisplayMod, StartingBoonSelector)
 - route compatibility with unmodded hades (so that routes are valid for the leaderboard)
 - accuracy of prediction
 
Non-goals:
 - compatibility with gameplay mods

To install, git clone into your Mods directory and run modimporter.py.
Requires ModUtil.
